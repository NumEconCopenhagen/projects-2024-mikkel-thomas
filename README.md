This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from World Bank, Uppsala Conflict Data Program, Caldara and Iacoviello (2022) and Bailey et al. (2017) on the state of war and peace in the world and show that the world in general has become more violent since 2020.
3. Model project. In this project, we extend the simple Ramsey model to include a durable asset in the form of a housing. We also allow for government capital in the production function.
