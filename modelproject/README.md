# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Ramsey model with housing and a government sector** and is about implementing hosing consumption into an otherwise standard Ramsey model. We also implement a government sector that taxes housing. We then also allow for government capital to be productive i.e. we include government capital into the production function. This government capital is financed by a tax on housing.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb). This file draws on the local modules ramsey_thje.py and shocks.py.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
