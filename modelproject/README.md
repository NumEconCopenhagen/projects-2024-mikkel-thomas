# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Ramsey model with housing and a government sector** and is about implementing hosing consumption into an otherwise standard Ramsey model. We also implement a government sector that taxes housing. We have so far only managed to implement the housing consumption into the utility function and simulate the effect of an increase in taxes in housing prices.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
